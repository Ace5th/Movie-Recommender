Dataset Description: The project utilizes the MovieLens dataset, a widely used dataset in the field of recommender systems, containing movie ratings and metadata. The dataset is preprocessed to create a user-item matrix and to calculate item similarity using cosine similarity. This enables the system to identify movies that are similar to the ones the user has previously enjoyed and recommend them accordingly.

The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that provides personalized movie recommendations to users using collaborative filtering.
